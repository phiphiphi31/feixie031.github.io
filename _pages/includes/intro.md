I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the [Vision and Learning Group](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/group.html), supervised by Prof. [Chao Ma](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn/). I worked with Prof. [Wankou Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=inPYAuYAAAAJ), Prof. [Kaihua Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=FYatMi8AAAAJ), Prof. [Wangmeng Zuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rUOpCEYAAAAJ), Dr.[Chunyu Wang](https://www.chunyuwang.org/), Dr.[Yue Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iRUO1ckAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), Dr. [Lei Chu](https://lei65537.github.io/), and Dr. [Jiahao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AcOcw0AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Currently, I work with Dr. [Zhongdao Wang](https://zhongdao.github.io/).

My research interests focus on computer vision tasks, such as visual object tracking, object detection, and segmentation. I also have a special interest in general vision backbone designs, such as vision transformers and mamba.
