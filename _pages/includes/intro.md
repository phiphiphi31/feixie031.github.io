I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Vision and Learning Group, supervised by Prof. Chao Ma. I worked with Prof. Wankou Yang, Prof. Kaihua Zhang, Prof. Wangmeng Zuo, Dr.Chunyu Wang, Dr.Yue Cao, Dr. Le Chu, and Dr. Jiahao Li. I currently work with Dr. Zhongdao Wang.

My research interests focus on computer vision tasks, such as visual object tracking, object detection, and segmentation. I also have a special interest in general vision backbone designs, such as vision transformers and mamba.
