I am a Ph.D. student at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Vision and Learning Group, supervised by Prof. Chao Ma. I have also worked with Dr. Jiankang Deng and Prof. Yichao Yan. Currently, I am focusing on computer vision tasks, such as visual object tracking, object detection, and segmentation, with a special interest in general vision backbone in transformer and mamba.

Prior to that, I received a bachelor's degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2016, a Master's degree from Southeast University.
